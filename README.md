# Motion planning algorithm
Given the start point, this project aims to find the goal point in a 2D matrix . To do so, we will transform a BFS code in Greedy code.

**General notation**
* 0: free space
* 1: ocupued (wall/obstacle)
* 2: visited point
* 3: start point
* 4: goal point

## Project Structure:
- **src/algorithms**: contains the BFS algorithm and the Greedy algorithms that have been implemented.
- **maps**: each map contains a `map.csv` with the matrix, a ``map.png ``with a picture of the map and a ``README.md`` that specifies the start and goal point.
- **Notebook**: jupyter notebook that contains blabla
